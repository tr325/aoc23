Playing with Go this year.

## Day 1 problem statement:

On each line of `calibration.txt`, the "calibration value" for that row can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number. The digits can be either [0-9] or spelled out in letters (eg. "one"). What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

## Day 2 problem statement:

1. How many of the inputs are possible if there are 12 Red, 13 Green, and 14 Blue balls total. Find the sum of their IDs.
2. Then, for each game, find the minimum number of balls possible for each colour, multiply those numbers together, and sum the results.

## Day 3 problem statement:

1. All numbers adjacent to a non-`.`-symbol are relevant engine parts. What's the sum of those numbers?
2. Gears are `*` symbols that are adjacent to exactly two engine parts. Their ratio is the multiple of those two parts. Find the sum of all gear ratios in the engine.
