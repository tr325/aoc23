Playing with Go this year.

## Day 1 problem statement:

On each line of `calibration.txt`, the "calibration value" for that row can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number. The digits can be either [0-9] or spelled out in letters (eg. "one"). What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
