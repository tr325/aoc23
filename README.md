Playing with Go this year.

## Day 1 problem statement:

On each line of `calibration.txt`, the "calibration value" for that row can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number. The digits can be either [0-9] or spelled out in letters (eg. "one"). What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

## Day 2 problem statement:

How many of the inputs are possible if there are 12 Green, 13 Blue, and 14 Red balls total. Find the sum of their IDs.
